	"I have had the privilege of editing for many different people and organizations " +
	"for more than a decade. I primarily work within the realms of poetry and fiction " +
	"and have worked as an editor with literary journals, such as the Valparaiso Fiction " +
	"Review and the Tiny Seed Literary Journal, and individual authors whose genres of " +
	"choice range dramatically in scope.",
	"I offer two types of editing: standard proofreading and developmental editing. No " +
	"matter which one you chose, I look forward to working with you and your work! Standard " +
	"proofreading deals more with helping out with grammar, syntax, line structure (in " + 
	"the case of poetry), and anything else the work needs on a technical level. " +
	"Developmental editing touches on the deeper and broader aspects of the text. This " +
	"includes helping with story structure, character development, messaging, feel, etc. " +
	"There are many times that technical and developmental editing can overlap, but I " +
	"can address this as we work together. Follow the dropdowns and Request More Info " +
	"link to reach out and start the conversation!"
